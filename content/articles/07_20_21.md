# Creating a Blog with Nuxt Content

* The content module is a git files based headless CMS that provides powerful features when it comes to write blogs, documentation sites or just adding content to any regular website.

To get started with content module, we need to first install the module
using npm
1) npm install @nuxt/content (this command will be done on webstorm's terminal)

To add it to my modules property inside my nuxt.config.js
2) export default {

   modules: ['@nuxt/content']
   
   }

To create markdown page,
1) mkdir content
2) mkdir content/articles
3) touch content/articles/my-first-blog-post.md
4) write something in our markdown file

for ex, # 
My first blog post!
Welcome to my first blog post using content module


## Displaying the content
* To display our content in our page, we can use a dynamic page by prefixing the page with an underscore(_). By creating a page component named _slug.vue inside our blog folder, we are able to use the params.slug variable provided by vue router to get the name of each article.
1) touch pages/blog/_slug.vue
2) ![](22.png)
* Then we can use asyncData in our page component to fetch our article content before the page has been rendered. We can have access to our content through the context by using the variable $content. As we want to fetch a dynamic page we also need to know which article to fetch with params.slug which is available to us through the context.

3) ![](33.png)
* To display our content we are using the <nuxt-content /> component by passing in the variable we returned into the document prop. In this example we have wrapped it in a HTML article tag as it is better semantic HTML but you can use a div or another HTML tag if you prefer.

##### Now we can run our dev server & go to route localhost3000/blog/my-first-blog-post
##### we will be able to see our mark down file as expected :)
